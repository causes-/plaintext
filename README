Plaintext
=========
Plaintext is a markup language for creating formatted
web sites without writing any formatting at all.
The project is just recently started and should not be used yet.
Please use the bundled style.html only as an example.

How it works
------------
* First you need to install plaintext interpreter:
$ make
$ make install
* Then configure httpd like this:
cgi.assign = ( ".pt"  => "/usr/bin/plaintext" )
* Then put a simple style.html file to your htdocs:
$PAGE gets replaced by the name of current page.
$PAGES gets replaced by list of links to all pages.
$CONTENT gets replaced by the document.
$HTTP_HOST gets replaced by the server hostname.
* Now just create .pt files in plain text and your site is ready to access.

Syntax
------
* URL => html link.
* URL to image => linked html image.
* $PAGES => links to all .pt files in the current directory
* Heading <h2> = First line after empty line
* Heading <h3> = Short lines not ending to ".".
* Line break <br> = line break \n
* Code block <pre> = lines starting with "$ " (shell command).
* List item <li> = line starting with "* "
